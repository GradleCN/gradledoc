In Gradle terms this
        means that you can define tasks and dependencies between tasks. Gradle guarantees that these tasks are executed
        in the order of their dependencies, and that each task is executed only once. Those tasks form a
        <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" target="_top">Directed Acyclic Graph</a>. There are
        build tools that build up such a dependency graph as they execute their tasks. Gradle builds the complete
        dependency graph <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> any task is executed. This lies at the heart of Gradle and makes
        many things possible which would not be possible otherwise.
    </p><p>Your build scripts configure this dependency graph. Therefore they are strictly speaking <span class="emphasis"><em>build
        configuration scripts</em></span>.

                        determines which projects are going to take part in the build, and creates a

                        In this mode, Gradle configures only relevant projects (see <a class="xref" href="multi_project_builds.html#sec:configuration_on_demand">Section&nbsp;56.1.1.1, &ldquo;Configuration on demand&rdquo;</a>).

The settings file is determined by Gradle
            via a naming convention. The default name for this file is <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code>. Later in
            this chapter we explain how Gradle looks for a settings file.
        </p><p>The settings file gets executed during the initialization phase. A multiproject build must have a
            <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code>
            file in the root project of the multiproject hierarchy. It is required because in the
            settings file it is defined, which projects are taking part in the multi-project build (see
            <a class="xref" href="multi_project_builds.html">Chapter&nbsp;56, <i>Multi-project Builds</i></a>). For a single-project build, a settings file is optional.
            You might need it for example, to add libraries to your build script classpath (see <a class="xref" href="organizing_build_logic.html">Chapter&nbsp;59, <i>Organizing Build Logic</i></a>). Let's first do some introspection with a single project

                the physical location of the project in the file system. However, this behavior is configurable.
                The project tree is created in the <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file.
                By default it is assumed that the location of the settings

If you trigger a multiproject build
            from the directory where the settings file is, things are easy. But Gradle also allows you to execute the
            build from within any subproject taking part in the build.
            <sup>[<a href="#ftn.N15DE5" name="N15DE5" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup>
            If you execute Gradle from within a project that has no <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file,
            Gradle does the following:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It searches for a <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> in a directory called <code class="filename">master</code>
                    which has the same nesting level as the current dir.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If no <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> is found, it searches the parent directories for the existence of a
                    <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If no <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file is found, the build is executed as a single project build.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If a <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file is found, Gradle checks if the current project is part of the
                    multiproject hierarchy defined in the found <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file. If not, the build is executed as a
                    single project build. Otherwise a multiproject build is executed.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>What is the purpose of this behavior? Somehow Gradle has to find out, whether the project you are into, is
            a subproject of a multiproject build or not. Of course, if it is a subproject, only the subproject and its
            dependent projects are build. But Gradle needs to create the build configuration for the whole multiproject
            build (see <a class="xref" href="multi_project_builds.html">Chapter&nbsp;56, <i>Multi-project Builds</i></a>). Via the <code class="option">-u</code>
            command line option, you can tell Gradle not to look in the parent hierarchy for a <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file. The
            current project is then always build as a single project build. If the current project contains a
            <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file, the <code class="option">-u</code> option has no meaning. Such a build is always executed as:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>a single project build, if the <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file does not define a multiproject hierarchy
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a multiproject build, if the <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file does define a multiproject hierarchy.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>The auto search for a settings file does only work for multi-project builds with a physical hierarchical
            or flat layout. For a flat layout you must additionally obey to the naming convention described above.
            Gradle supports arbitrary physical layouts for a multiproject build. But for such arbitrary layouts you need
            to execute the build from the directory where the settings file is located. For how to run partial builds
            from the root see <a class="xref" href="multi_project_builds.html#sec:running_partial_build_from_the_root">Section&nbsp;56.4, &ldquo;Running tasks by their absolute path&rdquo;</a>. In our next release we want to
            enable partial builds from subprojects by specifying the location of the settings file as a command line
            parameter. Gradle creates Project objects for every project taking part in the build. For a single
            project build this is only one project. For a multi-project build these are the projects specified in
            Settings object (plus the root project). Each project object has by default a name equals to the name of its
            top level directory. Every project except the root project has a parent project and might have child projects.

            phases are pretty simple. The build script is executed against the project object that was created during
            the initialization phase. Then Gradle looks for tasks with names equal to those passed as command line
            arguments. If these task names exist, they are executed as a separate build in the order you have passed
            them. The configuration and execution for multi-project builds is discussed in <a class="xref" href="multi_project_builds.html">Chapter&nbsp;56, <i>Multi-project Builds</i></a>.
