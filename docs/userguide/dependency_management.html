            compatible with a wide variety of approaches. If you are familiar with the approach used by either Maven or Ivy you will be delighted to learn that Gradle is fully compatible with both
            approaches in addition to being flexible enough to support fully-customized approaches.
        </p><p>Here are the major highlights of Gradle's support for dependency management:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Transitive dependency management</em></span>: Gradle gives you full control of your project's dependency tree.

                    to support this.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Support for custom dependency definitions.</em></span>: Gradle's Module Dependencies give you the ability to describe the dependency hierarchy in the build script.

                </p></li></ul></div><p>
            With hundreds of thousands of interdependent open source components each with a range of versions and incompatibilities, dependency management has a habit of causing problems as builds
            grow in complexity. When a build's dependency tree becomes unwieldy, your build tool shouldn't force you to adopt a single, inflexible approach to dependency management. A proper build
            system has to be designed to be flexible, and Gradle can handle any situation.
        </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sub:dependency_management_and_migrations"></a>50.1.1.&nbsp;Flexible dependency management for migrations</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Dependency management can be particularly challenging during a migration from one build system to another. If you are migrating from a tool like Ant or Maven to Gradle, you may be
                faced with some difficult situations. For example, one common pattern is an Ant project with version-less jar files stored in the filesystem. Other build systems require a wholesale
                replacement of this approach before migrating. With Gradle, you can adapt your new build to any existing source of dependencies or dependency metadata. This makes incremental migration
                to Gradle much easier than the alternative. On most large projects, build migrations and any change to development process is incremental because most organizations can't afford to
                stop everything and migrate to a build tool's idea of dependency management.
            </p><p>Even if your project is using a custom dependency management system or something like an Eclipse .classpath file as master data for dependency management, it is very easy to write a
                Gradle plugin to use this data in Gradle. For migration purposes this is a common technique with Gradle. (But, once you've migrated, it might be a good idea to move away from a
                .classpath file and use Gradle's dependency management features directly.)
            </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sub:dependency_management_and_java"></a>50.1.2.&nbsp;Dependency management and Java</h3></div></div></div><p>It is ironic that in a language known for its rich library of open source components that Java has no concept of libraries or versions. In Java, there is no standard way to tell the
                JVM that you are using version 3.0.5 of Hibernate, and there is no standard way to say that
                <code class="literal">foo-1.0.jar</code>
                depends on <code class="literal">bar-2.0.jar</code>. This has led to external solutions often based on build tools. The most popular ones at the moment are Maven and Ivy. While Maven provides a
                complete build system, Ivy focuses solely on dependency management.
            </p><p>Both tools rely on descriptor XML files, which contain information about the dependencies of a particular jar. Both also use repositories where the actual jars are placed together
                with their descriptor files, and both offer resolution for conflicting jar versions in one form or the other. Both have emerged as standards for solving dependency conflicts, and while
                Gradle originally used Ivy under the hood for its dependency management. Gradle has replaced this direct dependency on Ivy with a native Gradle dependency resolution engine which
                supports a range of approaches to dependency resolution including both POM and Ivy descriptor files.
            </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="sec:dependency_management_overview"></a>50.2.&nbsp;Dependency Management Best Practices</h2></div></div></div><p>While Gradle has strong opinions on dependency management, the tool gives you a choice between two
            options: follow recommended best practices or support any kind of pattern you can think of. This section
            outlines the Gradle project's recommended best practices for managing dependencies.
        </p><p>No matter what the language, proper dependency management is important for every project.
            From a complex enterprise application written in Java depending on hundreds of open source
            libraries to the simplest Clojure application depending on a handful of libraries, approaches to dependency
            management vary widely and can depend on the target technology, the method of application deployment, and the
            nature of the project. Projects bundled as reusable libraries may have different requirements than
            enterprise applications integrated into much larger systems of software and infrastructure. Despite this wide variation of requirements,
            the Gradle project recommends that all projects follow this set of core rules:
        </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sub:versioning_the_jar_name"></a>50.2.1.&nbsp;Put the Version in the Filename (Version the jar)</h3></div></div></div><p>The version of a library must be easy to recognize in the filename. While the version of a jar is usually in the Manifest file, it isn't readily apparent when you are inspecting a
                project. If someone asks you to look at a collection of 20 jar files, which would you prefer? A collection of files with names like <code class="filename">commons-beanutils-1.3.jar</code>
                or a collection of files with names like <code class="filename">spring.jar</code>? If dependencies have file names with version numbers it is much easier to quickly identify the versions of
                your dependencies.
            </p><p>If versions are unclear you can introduce subtle bugs which are very hard to find. For example there might be a project which uses Hibernate 2.5. Think about a developer who decides
                to install version 3.0.5 of Hibernate on her machine to fix a critical security bug but forgets to notify others in the team of this change. She may address the security bug
                successfully, but she also may have introduced subtle bugs into a codebase that was using a now-deprecated feature from Hibernate. Weeks later there is an exception on the integration
                machine which can't be reproduced on anyone's machine. Multiple developers then spend days on this issue only finally realising that the error would have easy to uncover if they knew
                that Hibernate had been upgraded from 2.5 to 3.0.5.
            </p><p>Versions in jar names increase the expressiveness of your project and make them easier to maintain. This practice also reduces the potential for error.
            </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sub:transitive_dependency_management"></a>50.2.2.&nbsp;Manage transitive dependencies</h3></div></div></div><p>Transitive dependency management is a technique that enables your project to depend on libraries which, in turn, depend on other libraries. This recursive pattern of transitive
                dependencies results in a tree of dependencies including your project's first-level dependencies, second-level dependencies, and so on. If you don't model your dependencies as a
                hierarchical tree of first-level and second-level dependencies it is very easy to quickly lose control over an assembled mess of unstructured dependencies. Consider the Gradle project
                itself, while Gradle only has a few direct, first-level dependencies, when Gradle is compiled it needs more that one hundred dependencies on the classpath. On a far larger scale,
                Enterprise projects using Spring, Hibernate, and other libraries, alongside hundreds or thousands of internal projects can have very large dependency trees.
            </p><p>When these large dependency trees need to change, you'll often have to solve some dependency version conflicts. Say one open source library needs one version of a logging library and
                a another uses an alternative version. Gradle and other build tools all have the ability to solve this dependency tree and resolve conflicts, but what differentiates Gradle is the
                control it gives you over transitive dependencies and conflict resolution.
            </p><p>While you could try to manage this problem manually, you will quickly find that this approach doesn't scale. If you want to get rid of a first level dependency you really can't be
                sure which other jars you should remove. A dependency of a first level dependency might also be a first level dependency itself, or it might be a transitive dependency of yet another
                first level dependency. If you try to manage transitive dependencies yourself, the end of the story is that your build becomes brittle: no one dares to change your dependencies because
                the risk of breaking the build is too high. The project classpath becomes a complete mess, and, if a classpath problem arises, hell on earth invites you for a ride.
            </p><div class="note"><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE:</em></span>In one project, we found a mystery, LDAP related jar in the classpath. No code referenced this jar and there was no connection to the project. No one could
                figure out what the jar was for, until it was removed from the build and the application suffered massive performance problem whenever it attempted to authenticate to LDAP. This
                mystery jar was a necessary transitive, fourth-level dependency that was easy to miss because no one had bothered to use managed transitive dependencies.
            </div><p>Gradle offers you different ways to express first-level and transitive dependencies. With Gradle you can mix and match approaches; for example, you could store your jars in an SCM
                without XML descriptor files and still use transitive dependency management.
            </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sub:version_conflicts"></a>50.2.3.&nbsp;Resolve version conflicts</h3></div></div></div><p>Conflicting versions of the same jar should be detected and either resolved or cause an exception. If you don't use transitive dependency management, version conflicts are undetected
                and the often accidental order of the classpath will determine what version of a dependency will win. On a large project with many developers changing dependencies, successful builds
                will be few and far between as the order of dependencies may directly affect whether a build succeeds or fails (or whether a bug appears or disappears in production).
            </p><p>If you haven't had to deal with the curse of conflicting versions of jars on a classpath, here is a small anecdote of the fun that awaits you. In a large project with 30
                submodules, adding a dependency to a subproject changed the order of a classpath, swapping Spring 2.5 for an older 2.4 version. While
                the build continued to work, developers were starting to notice all sorts of surprising (and surprisingly awful) bugs in production. Worse yet, this unintentional downgrade of Spring
                introduced several security vulnerabilities into the system, which now required a full security audit throughout the organization.
            </p><p>In short, version conflicts are bad, and you should manage your transitive dependencies to avoid them. You might also want to learn where conflicting versions are used and consolidate on a
                particular version of a dependency across your organization. With a good conflict reporting tool like Gradle, that information can be used to communicate with the entire organization
                and standardize on a single version.
                <span class="emphasis"><em>If you think version conflicts don't happen to you, think again.</em></span>
                It is very common for different first-level dependencies to rely on a range of different overlapping versions for other dependencies, and the JVM doesn't yet offer an easy way to have
                different versions of the same jar in the classpath (see <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sub:dependency_management_and_java">Section&nbsp;50.1.2, &ldquo;Dependency management and Java&rdquo;</a>).
            </p><p>Gradle offers the following conflict resolution strategies:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>Newest</em></span>: The newest version of the dependency is used. This is Gradle's default strategy, and is often an appropriate choice as long as versions are backwards-compatible.
                </li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>Fail</em></span>: A version conflict results in a build failure. This strategy enforces that all version conflicts are resolved explicitly in the build script. See
                    <a class="ulink" href="../dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">ResolutionStrategy</code></a> for details on how to explicitly choose a particular version.
                </li></ul></div><p>While the strategies introduced above are usually enough to solve most conflicts, Gradle provides more fine-grained mechanisms to resolve version conflicts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                    Configuring a first level dependency as <span class="emphasis"><em>forced</em></span>. This approach is useful if the dependency in conflict is already a first level dependency.
                    See examples in <a class="ulink" href="../dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">DependencyHandler</code></a>.
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    Configuring any dependency (transitive or not) as <span class="emphasis"><em>forced</em></span>. This approach is useful if the dependency in conflict is a transitive dependency.
                    It also can be used to force versions of first level dependencies.
                    See examples in <a class="ulink" href="../dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">ResolutionStrategy</code></a></li><li class="listitem">
                    Dependency resolve rules are an <a class="link" href="feature_lifecycle.html">incubating</a> feature introduced in Gradle 1.4 which give you fine-grained control over the version selected for a particular dependency.
                </li></ul></div><p>To deal with problems due to version conflicts, reports with dependency graphs are also very helpful. Such reports are another feature of dependency management.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sub:dynamic_versions_and_changing_modules"></a>50.2.4.&nbsp;Use Dynamic Versions and Changing Modules</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many situation when you want to use the latest version of a particular dependency, or the latest in a range of versions. This can be a requirement during development, or
                you may be developing a library that is designed to work with a range of dependency versions. You can easily depend on these constantly changing dependencies by using a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic version</em></span>. A dynamic version can be either a version range (e.g. <code class="literal">2.+</code>) or it can be a placeholder for the latest version available
                (e.g. <code class="literal">latest.integration</code>).
            </p><p>Alternatively, sometimes the module you request can change over time, even for the same version. An example of this type of <span class="emphasis"><em>changing module</em></span>
                is a Maven <code class="literal">SNAPSHOT</code> module, which always points at the latest artifact published. In other words, a standard Maven snapshot is a module that never stands still
                so to speak, it is a "changing module".
            </p><p>The main difference between a <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic version</em></span> and a <span class="emphasis"><em>changing module</em></span> is that when you resolve a <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic version</em></span>, you'll
                get the real, static version as the module name. When you resolve a <span class="emphasis"><em>changing module</em></span>, the artifacts are named using the version you requested, but the underlying
                artifacts may change over time.
            </p><p>By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions and changing modules for 24 hours. You can override the default cache modes using <a class="link" href="dependency_management.html#sec:cache_command_line_options">command
                line options</a>. You can change the cache expiry times in your build using the <code class="literal">resolution strategy</code> (see <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sec:controlling_caching">Section&nbsp;50.9.3, &ldquo;Fine-tuned control over dependency caching&rdquo;</a>).
            </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="sub:configurations"></a>50.3.&nbsp;Dependency configurations</h2></div></div></div><p>In Gradle dependencies are grouped into configurations. Configurations have a name, a number of other properties,
            and they can extend each other.
            Many Gradle plugin add pre-defined configurations to your project. The Java plugin, for example,
            adds some configurations to represent the various classpaths it needs. see
            <a class="xref" href="java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management">Section&nbsp;23.5, &ldquo;Dependency management&rdquo;</a>
            for details. Of course you can add custom configurations on top of that. There are many use cases
            for custom configurations. This is very handy for example for adding dependencies not needed for
            building or testing your software (e.g. additional JDBC drivers to be shipped with your distribution).
        </p><p>
            A project's configurations are managed by a <code class="literal">configurations</code> object. The closure you pass to
            the configurations object is applied against its API. To learn more about this API have a look at

                for more examples and a complete reference.
            </p><p>Gradle provides different notations for module dependencies. There is a string notation and
                a map notation. A module dependency has an API which allows for further configuration. Have a look at
                <a class="ulink" href="../javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ExternalModuleDependency.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">ExternalModuleDependency</code></a>
                to learn all about the API.
                This API provides properties and configuration methods. Via the string notation you can define a subset
                of the properties. With the map notation you can define all properties. To have access to the complete API,
                either with the map or with the string notation, you can assign a single dependency to a configuration
                together with a closure.
            </p><p>If you declare a module dependency, Gradle looks for a corresponding module descriptor file (<code class="filename">pom.xml</code> or
                <code class="filename">ivy.xml</code>) in the repositories. If such a module descriptor file exists, it is parsed and the artifacts of
                this module (e.g. <code class="filename">hibernate-3.0.5.jar</code>) as well as its dependencies (e.g. cglib) are downloaded. If no such
                module descriptor file exists, Gradle looks for a file called <code class="filename">hibernate-3.0.5.jar</code>
                to retrieve. In Maven, a module can have one and only one artifact. In Gradle and Ivy, a module can have multiple artifacts.
                Each artifact can have a different set of dependencies.
            </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ssub:multi_artifact_dependencies"></a>50.4.1.1.&nbsp;Depending on modules with multiple artifacts</h4></div></div></div>
                As mentioned earlier, a Maven module has only one artifact. Hence, when your project depends on a Maven module, it's obvious what its artifact is.
                With Gradle or Ivy, the case is different. Ivy's dependency descriptor (<code class="filename">ivy.xml</code>) can declare multiple artifacts.
                For more information, see the Ivy reference for <code class="filename">ivy.xml</code>.
                In Gradle, when you declare a dependency on an Ivy module, you actually declare a dependency on the <code class="literal">default</code> configuration of that module.
                So the actual set of artifacts (typically jars) you depend on is the set of artifacts that are associated with the
                <code class="literal">default</code> configuration of that module. Here are some situations where this matters:
                <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <code class="literal">default</code> configuration of a module contains undesired artifacts. Rather than depending on the
                        whole configuration, a dependency on just the desired artifacts is declared.
                    </li><li class="listitem">The desired artifact belongs to a configuration other than <code class="literal">default</code>. That configuration is explicitly named
                        as part of the dependency declaration.
                    </li></ul></div>
                There are other situations where it is necessary to fine-tune dependency declarations.
                Please see <a class="ulink" href="../dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">DependencyHandler</code></a> for examples and a complete reference for declaring dependencies.

                Not every transitive dependency can be excluded - some transitive dependencies might be essential
                for correct runtime behavior of the application. Generally, one can exclude transitive
                dependencies that are either not required by runtime or that are guaranteed to be available
                on the target environment/platform.
            </p><p>
                Should you exclude per-dependency or per-configuration?
                It turns out that in majority of cases you want to use the per-configuration exclusion.
                Here are the some exemplary reasons why one might want to exclude a transitive dependency.
                Bear in mind that for some of those use cases there are better solutions than exclusions!

For that use case please refer to <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sub:version_conflicts">Section&nbsp;50.2.3, &ldquo;Resolve version conflicts&rdquo;</a>
                        and the documentation on <a class="ulink" href="../dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">ResolutionStrategy</code></a> for a potentially better solution to the problem.
                    </li></ul></div><p>
                Basically, in most of the cases excluding the transitive dependency should be done per configuration.
                This way the dependency declaration is more explicit. It is also more accurate because a per-dependency
                exclude rule does not guarantee the given transitive dependency does not show up in the configuration.
                For example, some other dependency, which does not have any exclude rules, might pull in
                that unwanted transitive dependency.

                from a Maven repository, the default configuration is the only available one anyway. If you work with Ivy repositories and

                Since Gradle 1.2 there is also a new programmatic API to access the resolved dependency information.
                The dependency reports (see the previous paragraph) are using this API under the covers.
                The API lets you to walk the resolved dependency graph and provides information about the dependencies.
                With the coming releases the API will grow to provide more information about the resolution result.

            Below is a brief outline of how this process works.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>
                    Given a required dependency, Gradle first attempts to resolve the <span class="emphasis"><em>module</em></span> for that dependency. Each repository is inspected in order, searching
                    first for a <span class="emphasis"><em>module descriptor</em></span> file (POM or Ivy file) that indicates the presence of that module. If no module descriptor is found,
                    Gradle will search for the presence of the primary <span class="emphasis"><em>module artifact</em></span> file indicating that the module exists in the repository.
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If the dependency is declared as a dynamic version (like <code class="literal">1.+</code>), Gradle will resolve this to the newest available static version (like
                            <code class="literal">1.2</code>) in the repository. For Maven repositories, this is done using the <code class="literal">maven-metadata.xml</code>
                            file, while for Ivy repositories this is done by directory listing.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the module descriptor is a POM file that has a parent POM declared, Gradle will recursively attempt to resolve each of the parent modules for the POM.
                        </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once each repository has been inspected for the module, Gradle will choose the 'best' one to use. This is done using the following criteria:
                    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">For a dynamic version, a 'higher' static version is preferred over a 'lower' version.</li><li class="listitem">Modules declared by a module descriptor file (Ivy or POM file) are preferred over modules that have an artifact file only.</li><li class="listitem">Modules from earlier repositories are preferred over modules in later repositories.</li></ul></div><p>
                </p><p>When the dependency is declared by a static version and a module descriptor file is found in a repository, there is no need to continue searching later
                    repositories and the remainder of the process is short-circuited.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All of the artifacts for the module are then requested from the <span class="emphasis"><em>same repository</em></span> that was chosen in the process above.

In some cases, however, it can be necessary to tweak
            dependency resolution to ensure that your build receives exactly the right dependencies.
        </p><p>There are a number of ways that you can influence how Gradle resolves dependencies.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sec:forcing_modules"></a>50.8.1.&nbsp;Forcing a particular module version</h3></div></div></div><p>Forcing a module version tells Gradle to always use a specific version for given dependency (transitive or not), overriding any version specified in a
                published module descriptor. This can be very useful when tackling version conflicts - for more information see <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sub:version_conflicts">Section&nbsp;50.2.3, &ldquo;Resolve version conflicts&rdquo;</a>.
            </p><p>
                Force versions can also be used to deal with rogue metadata of transitive dependencies.
                If a transitive dependency has poor quality metadata that leads to problems at dependency resolution time, you can force Gradle to use a newer, fixed version of this dependency.
                For an example, see <a class="ulink" href="../dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html" target="_top"><code class="classname">ResolutionStrategy</code></a>.
                Note that 'dependency resolve rules' (outlined below) provide a more powerful mechanism for replacing a broken module dependency. See <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sec:blacklisting_version">Section&nbsp;50.8.2.3, &ldquo;Blacklisting a particular version with a replacement&rdquo;</a>.
            </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sec:dependency_resolve_rules"></a>50.8.2.&nbsp;Using dependency resolve rules</h3></div></div></div><p>A dependency resolve rule is executed for each resolved dependency, and offers a powerful api for manipulating a requested dependency prior to that dependency being resolved.
                This feature is <a class="link" href="feature_lifecycle.html">incubating</a>, but currently offers the ability to change the group, name and/or version of a requested dependency,
                allowing a dependency to be substituted with a completely different module during resolution.
            </p><p>
                Dependency resolve rules provide a very powerful way to control the dependency resolution process, and can be used to implement all sorts of advanced
                patterns in dependency management. Some of these patterns are outlined below.

                    These libraries form a 'releasable unit', designed and intended to be used as a whole. It does not make sense to use libraries from different releasable units together.
                </p><p>
                    But it is easy for transitive dependency resolution to violate this contract. For example:
                    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">module-a</code> depends on <code class="literal">releasable-unit:part-one:1.0</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">module-b</code> depends on <code class="literal">releasable-unit:part-two:1.1</code></li></ul></div><p>
                    A build depending on both <code class="literal">module-a</code> and <code class="literal">module-b</code> will obtain different versions of libraries within the releasable unit.
                </p><p>
                    Dependency resolve rules give you the power to enforce releasable units in your build.
                    Imagine a releasable unit defined by all libraries that have 'org.gradle' group. We can force all of these libraries to use a consistent version:

                    Dependency resolve rules provide a mechanism for blacklisting a particular version of a dependency and providing a replacement version.
                    This can be useful if a certain dependency version is broken and should not be used,
                    where a dependency resolve rule causes this version to be replaced with a known good version.
                    One example of a broken module is one that declares a dependency on a library that cannot be found in any of the public repositories,
                    but there are many other reasons why a particular module version is unwanted and a different version is preferred.
                </p><p>
                    In example below, imagine that version <code class="literal">1.2.1</code> contains important fixes and should always be used in preference to <code class="literal">1.2</code>.
                    The rule provided will enforce just this: any time version <code class="literal">1.2</code> is encountered it will be replaced with <code class="literal">1.2.1</code>.
                    Note that this is different from a forced version as described above, in that any other versions of this module would not be affected.
                    This means that the 'newest' conflict resolution strategy would still select version <code class="literal">1.3</code> if this version was also pulled transitively.

                Gradle's Ivy repository implementations support the equivalent to Ivy's dynamic resolve mode. Normally, Gradle will use the <code class="literal">rev</code> attribute for each dependency
                definition included in an <code class="filename">ivy.xml</code> file. In dynamic resolve mode, Gradle will instead prefer the <code class="literal">revConstraint</code> attribute over the
                <code class="literal">rev</code> attribute for a given dependency definition. If the <code class="literal">revConstraint</code> attribute is not present, the <code class="literal">rev</code> attribute is used
                instead.
            </p><p>To enable dynamic resolve mode, you need to set the appropriate option on the repository definition. A couple of examples are shown below. Note that dynamic resolve mode is only
                available for Gradle's Ivy repositories. It is not available for Maven repositories, or custom Ivy <code class="classname">DependencyResolver</code> implementations.</p><div class="example"><a name="dynamicResolveMode"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;50.44.&nbsp;Enabling dynamic resolve mode</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p><code class="filename">build.gradle</code></p><pre class="programlisting"><span xmlns:xslthl="http://xslthl.sf.net" class="hl-comment">// Can enable dynamic resolve mode when you define the repository</span>

                This metadata typically originates in the module's descriptor. Metadata rules allow certain parts of a module's metadata to be manipulated
                from within the build script. They take effect after a module's descriptor has been downloaded, but before it has been selected among all candidate versions.
                This makes metadata rules another instrument for customizing dependency resolution.
            </p><p>
                One piece of module metadata that Gradle understands is a module's <span class="emphasis"><em>status scheme</em></span>. This concept, also known from Ivy, models the different
                levels of maturity that a module transitions through over time. The default status scheme, ordered from least to most mature status, is <code class="literal">integration</code>,
                <code class="literal">milestone</code>, <code class="literal">release</code>. Apart from a status scheme, a module also has a (current) <span class="emphasis"><em>status</em></span>, which must be one of
                the values in its status scheme. If not specified in the (Ivy) descriptor, the status defaults to <code class="literal">integration</code> for Ivy modules and Maven snapshot modules,
                and <code class="literal">release</code> for Maven modules that aren't snapshots.
            </p><p>
                A module's status and status scheme are taken into consideration when a <code class="literal">latest</code> version selector is resolved. Specifically, <code class="literal">latest.someStatus</code>
                will resolve to the highest module version that has status <code class="literal">someStatus</code> or a more mature status. For example, with the default status scheme in place,
                <code class="literal">latest.integration</code> will select the highest module version regardless of its status (because <code class="literal">integration</code> is the least mature status),
                whereas <code class="literal">latest.release</code> will select the highest module version with status <code class="literal">release</code>. Here is what this looks like in code:

            dependency resolution, while striving to guarantee that the results of dependency resolution are correct and reproducible.
        </p><p>
            The Gradle dependency cache consists of 2 key types of storage:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A file-based store of downloaded artifacts, including binaries like jars as well as raw downloaded meta-data like POM files and Ivy files.
                    The storage path for a downloaded artifact includes the SHA1 checksum, meaning that 2 artifacts with the same name but different content can easily be cached.
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A binary store of resolved module meta-data, including the results of resolving dynamic versions, module descriptors, and artifacts.</p></li></ul></div><p>Separating the storage of downloaded artifacts from the cache metadata permits us to do some very powerful things with our cache that would be difficult with a transparent,
            file-only cache layout.
        </p><p>The Gradle cache does not allow the local cache to hide problems and creating mysterious and difficult to debug behavior
            that has been a challenge with many build tools. This new behavior is implemented in a bandwidth and storage efficient way.
            In doing so, Gradle enables reliable and reproducible enterprise builds.
        </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sec:cache_features"></a>50.9.1.&nbsp;Key features of the Gradle dependency cache</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sub:cache_metadata"></a>50.9.1.1.&nbsp;Separate metadata cache</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Gradle keeps a record of various aspects of dependency resolution in binary format in the metadata cache.
                    The information stored in the metadata cache includes:
                    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The result of resolving a dynamic version (e.g. <code class="literal">1.+</code>) to a concrete version (e.g. <code class="literal">1.2</code>).</li><li class="listitem">The resolved module metadata for a particular module, including module artifacts and module dependencies.</li><li class="listitem">The resolved artifact metadata for a particular artifact, including a pointer to the downloaded artifact file.</li><li class="listitem">The

                            eliminating repeated attempts to access a resource that does not exist.
                        </li></ul></div><p>
                    Every entry in the metadata cache includes a record of the repository that provided the information as well as a timestamp that can be used for cache expiry.
                </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sub:cache_repository_independence"></a>50.9.1.2.&nbsp;Repository caches are independent</h4></div></div></div><p>As described above, for each repository there is a separate metadata cache. A repository is identified by its URL, type and layout.
                    If a module or artifact has not been previously resolved from <span class="emphasis"><em>this repository</em></span>, Gradle will attempt to resolve the module
                    against the repository. This will always involve a remote lookup on the repository, however in many cases no download will be required (see<a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sub:cache_artifact_reuse">Section&nbsp;50.9.1.3, &ldquo;Artifact reuse&rdquo;</a>, below).
                </p><p>Dependency resolution will fail if the required artifacts are not available in any repository specified by the build,
                    regardless whether the local cache has retrieved this artifact from a different repository.
                    Repository independence allows builds to be isolated from each other in an advanced way that no build tool has done before.
                    This is a key feature to create builds that are reliable and reproducible in any environment.

                    with that artifact. If the checksum can be retrieved, an artifact is not downloaded if an artifact already exists with the same id and checksum.
                    If the checksum cannot be retrieved from the remote server, the artifact will be downloaded (and ignored if it matches an existing artifact).
                </p><p>As well as considering artifacts downloaded from a different repository, Gradle will also attempt to reuse artifacts found in the local Maven Repository.
                    If a candidate artifact has been downloaded by Maven, Gradle will use this artifact if it can be verified to match the checksum declared by the remote server.
                </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sub:cache_checksum_storage"></a>50.9.1.4.&nbsp;Checksum based storage</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    It is possible for different repositories to provide a different binary artifact in response to the same artifact identifier. This is often the case with Maven SNAPSHOT
                    artifacts, but can also be true for any artifact which is republished without changing it's identifier.
                    By caching artifacts based on their SHA1 checksum, Gradle is able to maintain multiple versions of the same artifact. This means that when resolving against
                    one repository Gradle will never overwrite the cached artifact file from a different repository. This is done without requiring a separate artifact file store per repository.

                    The Gradle dependency cache uses file-based locking to ensure that it can safely be used by multiple Gradle processes concurrently. The lock is held whenever the binary
                    meta-data store is being read or written, but is released for slow operations such as downloading remote artifacts.

                    command line switch tells Gradle to always use dependency modules from the cache, regardless if they are due to be checked again.
                    When running with offline, Gradle will never attempt to access the network to perform dependency resolution.
                    If required modules are not present in the dependency cache, build execution will fail.

Perhaps a repository was initially misconfigured,
                    or perhaps a "non-changing" module was published incorrectly. To refresh all dependencies in the dependency cache, use the
                    <code class="literal">--refresh-dependencies</code> option on the command line.
                </p><p>The <code class="literal">--refresh-dependencies</code> option tells Gradle to ignore all cached entries for resolved modules and artifacts.
                    A fresh resolve will be performed against all configured repositories, with dynamic versions recalculated, modules refreshed, and artifacts downloaded.
                    However, where possible Gradle will check if the previously downloaded artifacts are valid before downloading again.
                    This is done by comparing published SHA1 values in the repository with the SHA1 values for existing downloaded artifacts.

            <sup>[<a href="#ftn.N15329" name="N15329" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup>
            But it can be tedious, to keep it up to date. For a new version, you have always to create the new XML
            descriptor and the directories. And your custom repository is another infrastructure element which might
            have downtimes and needs to be updated. To enable historical builds, you need to keep all the past
            libraries and you need a backup. It is another layer of indirection. Another source of information
            you have to lookup. All this is not really a big deal but in its sum it has an impact. Repository Manager like
            Artifactory or Nexus make this easier. But for example open source projects don't usually have a host for those products.
            This is changing with new services like <a class="ulink" href="http://bintray.com" target="_top">Bintray</a> that let developers host and
            distribute their release binaries using a self-service repository platform. Bintray also supports sharing approved artifacts
            though the <a class="ulink" href="http://jcenter.bintray.com" target="_top">JCenter</a> public repository to provide a single resolution address for
            all popular OSS java artifacts (see <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#sub:maven_jcenter">Section&nbsp;50.6.2, &ldquo;Maven JCenter repository&rdquo;</a>).
        </p><p>This is a reason why some projects prefer to store their libraries in their version control system. This
            approach is fully supported by Gradle. The libraries can be stored in a flat directory without any XML module
            descriptor files. Yet Gradle offers complete transitive dependency management. You can use either client module
            dependencies to express the dependency relations, or artifact dependencies in case a first level dependency has no
            transitive dependencies. People can check out such a project from svn and have everything necessary to build it.
        </p><p>If you are working with a distributed version control system like Git you probably don't want to
            use the version control system to store libraries as people check out the whole history. But even here the flexibility
            of Gradle can make your life easier. For example you can use a shared flat directory without XML descriptors and
            yet you can have full transitive dependency management as described above.
        </p><p>You could also have a mixed strategy. If your main concern is bad metadata in the POM file and maintaining custom XML descriptors,
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Client Modules</em></span> offer an alternative. But you can of course still use Maven2 repo and your custom repository as a repository for
            <span class="emphasis"><em>jars only</em></span> and still enjoy <span class="emphasis"><em>transitive</em></span> dependency management. Or you can only provide client modules for POMs with bad metadata. For the
            jars and the correct POMs you still use the remote repository.

You can do this with Gradle, but we don't recommend it.
                We mention it for the sake of completeness and comparison with other build tools.
            </p><p>The trick is to use only artifact dependencies and group them in lists. That way you have somehow
                expressed, what are your first level dependencies and what are transitive dependencies (see <a class="xref" href="dependency_management.html#para:notation_collections">Section&nbsp;50.4.8, &ldquo;Optional attributes&rdquo;</a>).
                But the draw-back is, that for the Gradle dependency management all dependencies are considered first level dependencies. The
                dependency reports don't show your real dependency graph and the <code class="literal">compile</code>
                task uses all dependencies, not just the first level dependencies. All in all, your build is less
                maintainable and reliable than it could be when using client modules. And you don't gain anything.

                    probably want to set-up a repository proxy for this. In an enterprise environment this is rather
                    common. For an open source project it looks like overkill.
