        monolithic application. It&rsquo;s often much easier to digest and understand a project that has been split into
        smaller, inter-dependent modules. The word &ldquo;inter-dependent&rdquo; is important, though, and is why you typically
        want to link the modules together through a single build.</p><p>Gradle supports this scenario through <em class="firstterm">multi-project</em> builds.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a xmlns:xslthl="http://xslthl.sf.net" name="sec:structure_of_a_multiproject_build" class="section-anchor" href="#sec:structure_of_a_multiproject_build"></a>8.1.&nbsp;Structure of a multi-project build</h2></div></div></div><p>Such builds come in all shapes and sizes, but they do have some common characteristics:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file in the root or <code class="literal">master</code>
                directory of the project</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A <code class="filename">build.gradle</code> file in the root or <code class="literal">master</code>
                directory</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Child directories that have their own <code class="filename">*.gradle</code> build files
                (some multi-project builds may omit child project build scripts)</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>The <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file tells Gradle how the project and subprojects are
            structured. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t have to read this file simply to learn what the project structure
            is as you can run the command <strong class="userinput"><code>gradle projects</code></strong>. Here's the output from using
            that command on the Java <span class="emphasis"><em>multiproject</em></span> build in the Gradle samples:

Root project
------------------------------------------------------------

Root project 'multiproject'
+--- Project ':api'
+--- Project ':services'
|    +--- Project ':services:shared'
|    \--- Project ':services:webservice'
\--- Project ':shared'

To see a list of the tasks of a project, run gradle &lt;project-path&gt;:tasks
For example, try running gradle :api:tasks
</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
        </p><p>This tells you that <span class="emphasis"><em>multiproject</em></span> has three immediate child projects:
            <span class="emphasis"><em>api</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>services</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>shared</em></span>. The
            <span class="emphasis"><em>services</em></span> project then has its own children, <span class="emphasis"><em>shared</em></span> and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>webservice</em></span>. These map to the directory structure, so it&rsquo;s easy to find them.
            For example, you can find <span class="emphasis"><em>webservice</em></span> in
            <code class="filename">&lt;root&gt;/services/webservice</code>.</p><p>
            By default, Gradle uses the name of the directory it finds the <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> as the name of the root project.
            This usually doesn't cause problems since all developers check out the same directory name when working on a project.
            On Continuous Integration servers, like Jenkins, the directory name may be auto-generated and not match the name in your VCS.
            For that reason, it's recommended that you always set the root project name to something predictable, even in single project builds.
            You can configure the root project name by setting <code class="literal">rootProject.name</code>.
        </p><p>Each project will usually have its own build file, but that's not necessarily the case. In the above
            example, the <span class="emphasis"><em>services</em></span> project is just a container or grouping of other subprojects.
            There is no build file in the corresponding directory. However, <span class="emphasis"><em>multiproject</em></span> does
            have one for the root project.</p><p>The root <code class="filename">build.gradle</code> is often used to share common configuration between the
            child projects, for example by applying the same sets of plugins and dependencies to all the child
            projects. It can also be used to configure individual subprojects when it is preferable to have
            all the configuration in one place. This means you should always check the root build file when
            discovering how a particular subproject is being configured.</p><p>Another thing to bear in mind is that the build files might not be called
            <code class="filename">build.gradle</code>. Many projects will name the build files after the subproject names,
            such as <code class="filename">api.gradle</code> and <code class="filename">services.gradle</code> from the previous
            example. Such an approach helps a lot in IDEs because it&rsquo;s tough to work out which
            <code class="filename">build.gradle</code> file out of twenty possibilities is the one you want to open. This
            little piece of magic is handled by the <code class="filename">settings.gradle</code> file, but as a build user
            you don&rsquo;t need to know the details of how it&rsquo;s done. Just have a look through the child project
            directories to find the files with the <code class="filename">.gradle</code> suffix.</p><p>Once you know what subprojects are available, the key question for a build user is how to execute the
            tasks within the project.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a xmlns:xslthl="http://xslthl.sf.net" name="sec:executing_a_multiproject_build" class="section-anchor" href="#sec:executing_a_multiproject_build"></a>8.2.&nbsp;Executing a multi-project build</h2></div></div></div><p>From a user's perspective, multi-project builds are still collections of tasks you can run. The
            difference is that you may want to control <span class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> project's tasks get executed.
            You have two options here:

            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Change to the directory corresponding to the subproject you&rsquo;re interested in and
                    just execute <strong class="userinput"><code>gradle &lt;task&gt;</code></strong> as normal.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use a qualified task name from any directory, although this is usually done from
                    the root. For example: <strong class="userinput"><code>gradle :services:webservice:build</code></strong> will build the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>webservice</em></span> subproject and any subprojects it depends on.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>The first approach is similar to the single-project use case, but Gradle works slightly differently
            in the case of a multi-project build. The command <strong class="userinput"><code>gradle test</code></strong> will execute the
            <code class="literal">test</code> task in any subprojects, relative to the current working directory, that have
            that task. So if you run the command from the root project directory, you&rsquo;ll run <code class="literal">test</code>
            in <span class="emphasis"><em>api</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>shared</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>services:shared</em></span> and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>services:webservice</em></span>. If you run the command from the services project directory,
            you&rsquo;ll only execute the task in <span class="emphasis"><em>services:shared</em></span> and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>services:webservice</em></span>.</p><p>For more control over what gets executed, use qualified names (the second approach mentioned). These
            are paths just like directory paths, but use &lsquo;:&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;/&rsquo; or &lsquo;\&rsquo;. If the path begins with a &lsquo;:&rsquo;,
            then the path is resolved relative to the root project. In other words, the leading &lsquo;:&rsquo; represents the
            root project itself. All other colons are path separators.</p><p>This approach works for any task, so if you want to know what tasks are in a particular subproject,
            just use the <code class="literal">tasks</code> task, e.g. <strong class="userinput"><code>gradle :services:webservice:tasks</code></strong>
            .</p><p>Regardless of which technique you use to execute tasks, Gradle will take care of building any
            subprojects that the target depends on. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about the inter-project dependencies
            yourself. If you&rsquo;re interested in how this is configured, you can read about writing multi-project builds
            <a class="link" href="multi_project_builds.html">later in the user guide</a>.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one last thing to note. When you&rsquo;re using the Gradle wrapper, the first approach doesn&rsquo;t work
            well because you have to specify the path to the wrapper script if you&rsquo;re not in the project root. For
            example, if you&rsquo;re in the <span class="emphasis"><em>webservice</em></span> subproject directory, you would have to run
            <strong class="userinput"><code>../../gradlew build</code></strong>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all you really need to know about multi-project builds as a build user. You can now identify whether
            a build is a multi-project one and you can discover its structure. And finally, you can execute tasks
            within specific subprojects.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><div><div class="navbar"><a xmlns:xslthl="http://xslthl.sf.net" href="artifact_dependencies_tutorial.html" title="Dependency Management Basics - Gradle User Guide Version 3.2">Previous</a><span>|</span><a xmlns:xslthl="http://xslthl.sf.net" href="userguide.html" title="Gradle User Guide Version 3.2">Contents</a><span>|</span><a xmlns:xslthl="http://xslthl.sf.net" href="continuous_build.html" title="Continuous build - Gradle User Guide Version 3.2">Next</a></div></div></div></body></html>
